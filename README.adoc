== Spock vs Supermutants
=== Specification testing meets mutation testing

The Spock test framework uses the expressive Groovy to realize BDD as a test approach.
Besides a clear test structure, it scores with readable reports, which can also be generated in AsciiDoc thanks to a
template engine. Can this be improved? We take the proof and combine Spock with mutation tests.
Because a test coverage of over 80% does not yet prove that the test suite is capable of reliably detecting errors. The presentation shows how Spock can be combined with mutation tests to form a clever duo.
